* Extrema of a Function

** Absolute Extrema

An absolute extremum can only exist in an open interval of $f$. A closed interval has an infinite amount of values that approach the start and end of the intervals, so it is impossible to define an exact extremum on a closed interval.

There may not be an absolute extremum in a function if the function is unbounded.

** Local Extrema

A local extremum exists at point $x$ if $f'(x) = 0$ with odd multiplicity (i.e. the function /passes/ $y = 0$). A value of $x$ with even multiplicity (e.g. $f'(x) = (x -2)^2$) will simply bounce off the y-axis, and $f'(x)$ does not change sign at $x$.

If the sign of $f'(x)$ at $x$ changes from *negative to positive*, there must exist a *local minimum* at $(x, f(x))$.

If the sign changes from *positive to negative*, there must exist a *local maximum* at $(x, f(x))$.

If the function has a removable discontinuity, a local maximum exists when  $f(x) > \lim_{c \to x} f(c)$ and a local minimum exists when $f(x) < \lim_{c \to x} f(c)$

** Extreme Value Theorem

If the function is *continuous* on a *closed* interval, then it must have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.

* Mean Value Theorem (Derivatives)

If $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, then a value $x = c$ must exist in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$

*Note:* This means that within the interval, there must be a /tangent/ line with the same slope as the /secant/ line that passes through the endpoints of the interval.

** Example

Show that the function $f(x) = x^2$ satisfies the hypotheses of the MVT over the interval $[-2, 4]$. Then find a value of $c$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$ on this interval.

*Solution:*

The interval $[a, b]$ = $[-2, 4]$

$f(x) = x^2$

$f'(x) = 2x$

$\frac{f(4) - f(-2)}{4 - (-2)} = 2$

$f'(c) = 2 = 2c$

$c = 1$

In a graph, the slope of the secant line from $(a, f(a))$ to $(b, f(b))$ *will be the same* as the slope of the tangent line at $(c, f(c))$

** Example 2

Determine whether or not the function $f(x) = |x|$ satisfies the hypotheses of the MVT over the following intervals. If yes, find the values of $c$ guaranteed by the MVT.

1. $[-2, 2]$

   The interval in $[-2, 2]$ is continuous, but it's not differentiable when $x = 0$. Therefore, it does not satisfy the conditions of the MVT.

2. $[0, 4]$

   The interval $[0, 4]$ is continuous, and the interval $(0, 4)$ is differentiable.$f'(x) = 1$ if $x > 0$

    $\frac{f(4) - f(0)}{4 - 0} = 1$

** Rolle's Theorem

*Definition:* Let the function $f$ be continuous of the closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$. If $f(a) = f(b)$, then there is at least one number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

In other words, if $f(a) = f(b)$, then there is at least one point where the *average slope is zero* between $[a, b]$.

*** Example

$f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2$

$f'(x) = 4x^3 - 4x$

$f'(c) = 4c^3 - 4c = 0$

$c = 0$

** Example 3

Show that the function $f(x) = x^3$ satisfies the hypothesis of the MVT over the interval $[0, 1]$. Find a value of $c$.

* First Derivative - Increasing/Decreasing

- *Increasing Function* - A function is increasing on the interval $I$ if for all $x_1 < x_2$ in $I, f(x_1) < f(x_2)$

  Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$.

  $f$ *increases* on $[a, b]$ if $f' > 0$.

- *Decreasing Function* - A function is decreasing on the interval $I$ if for all $x_1 > x_2$ in $I, f(x_1) > f(x_2)$

  Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$.

  $f$ *decreases* on $[a, b]$ if $f' > 0$.

- *Monotonic Function* - A function that is /strictly/ increasing or decreasing on an interval.

- *Constant Function* - A function that can be defined as $f(x) = C$, where $C$ is a constant, and $f'(x) = 0$

*** Examples

1. Determine what intervals the function $f(x) = x^3 - 27x$ is increasing and decreasing.

   $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 27 = 0$

   $3(x + 3)(x - 3) = 0$

   $x = \{ -3, 3 \}$

   $f'(-4) > 0$

   $f'(-2) < 0$

   $f'(4) > 0$

   :         +        -         +
   :     <-------|----------|------->
   :            -3          3

   $f$ is increasing on the interval $(-\infty, -3] \cup [3, \infty)$ and decreasing on the interval $[-3, 3]$

2. $f(x) = xe^{\frac{1}{x}}$

   \[
   f'(x) = x \cdot e^{\frac{1}{x}} \cdot -x^{-2} + e^{\frac{1}{x}} \cdot 1 = 0
   \]

   $f'(x) = (e^\frac{1}{x})(-x^{-1} + 1)$

   $f'(x) = e^\frac{1}{x}(\frac{x - 1}{x}) = 0$

   $x = 1$ , and $f'(x) = \textrm{DNE}$ if $x = 0$

   $f(-1) > 0$

   $f(\frac{1}{2}) < 0$

   $f(2) > 0$

   $f$ is increasing on $(-\infty, 0) \cup [1, \infty)$ and decreasing on $(0, 1)$


*** Sample AP Question

1. The graph of $f'$, the derivative of the function $f$, is shown.

   [[./ap-question-interval.png]]

   Which of the following statements is true about $f$?

   (A) $f$ is decreasing for $-1 \ge x \ge 1$

   *(B) $f$ is increasing for $-2 \ge x \ge 0$*

* Second Derivative - Concavity

- A function is *concave up* on an open interval if $f'$ is increasing
- A function is *concave down* on an open interval $f'$ is decreasing

** Concavity Test

- *Concave up* on any interval where $f''(x) > 0$
- *Concave down* on any interval where $f''(x) < 0$
- *Point of inflection* - a point where the graph of a function has a tangent line and where the concavity/sign /changes/ (i.e. the point $(x, f(x))$ such that $f''(x) = 0$)
  - A possible POI may exist when $f''(x) = 0$, but a POI must exist when the sign changes

** Examples

1. Determine the concavity of $y = 2 + \sin x$ on $[0, 2\pi]$ and any points of inflection.

   $y' = \cos x$

   $y'' = -\sin x = 0$

   $x = \{ 0, \pi, 2\pi \}$

   $y'' < 0$ if $0 < x < \pi$ - *concavity down* at $(0, \pi)$

   $y'' > 0$ is $\pi < x < 2\pi$ - *concavity up* at $(\pi, 2\pi)$

2. Determine the concavity of $f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 4}$

   $f''(x) = \frac{4x(x^2 + 12)}{(x^2 - 4)^3}$

   $f''(0) = 0$

   $f''(\pm 2) = \textrm{DNE}$

   $f''(-3) < 0$

   $f''(-1) > 0$

   $f''(1) < 0$

   $f''(3) > 0$

   :     -       +      -       +
   : <-------------------------------> f''(x)
   :        |       |       |
   :        2       0      4/3

   *Concavity down* on $(-\infty, -2) \cup (0, 2)$

   *Concavity up* on $(-2, 0) \cup (2, \infty)$

   3 possible points of inflection: $\{ -2, 0, 2 \}$

   Since $\pm 2$ does not exist in the domain of the original function, they could not be considered points of inflection. Therefore, the only point of inflection is $(0, 0)$.

3. $f'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x^2$

   $f''(x) = 12x^2 - 16x$

   $f''(x) = 4x(3x - 4)$

   $x = \{0, \frac{4}{3}\}$

   $f''(x) > 0; x = -1$

   $f''(x) < 0; x = 1$

   $f''(x) > 0; x = 2$

   :       +         -          +
   :   <-------------------------------> f''(x)
   :         |         |
   :             0        4/3

   *Concavity down* on $(0, \frac{4}{3})$

   *Convacity up* on $(-\infty, 0) \cup (\frac{4}{3}, \infty)$

** Sample AP Questions

1. Let $f$ be the function given by $f(x) = 2xe^x$.  The graph of $f$  is concave down when

   $f'(x) = 2e^x + 2xe^x$

   $f''(x) = 2e^x + 6xe^x$

   $x = \{ -2, 0 \}$

   :          -
   :   <-------------------------------> f''(x)
   :              |      |
   :             -2      0

   *Concave down* $(-\infty, -2)$

2. The second derivative of the function $f$ is given by $f''(x) = x(x - a)(x - b)^2$. The graph of $f''(x)$ is shown. For what values does $f$ have a point of inflection?

   [[./ap-question-poi.png]]

   $f$ has a *point of inflection at $0, a, b$* because the value of $f$ at those points is zero. By definition, it is a point of inflection.

3. The function $f$ has first derivative given by $f'(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{1 + x + x^3}$

   $f''(x) = \frac{-5x^3 - x + 1}{2\sqrt{x}(1 + x + x^3)^2} = 0$

   $-5x^3 - x + 1 = 0$ Solve the numerator for 0

   $x = 0.473$ (x-coordinate of point of inflection)

4. For all $x$ in the closed interval $[2, 5]$, the function $f$ has a positive first derivative and a derivative. Which of the following could be a table of values for $f$?

   [[./ap-question-poi-tables.png]]

   B is most likely the answer because $f$ in that interval is concave down. Therefore, the rate of change should slow down but not be negative.

* Second Derivative Test

If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) < 0$, then a local maximum exists at $x = c$. If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) > 0$, then a local minimum exists at $x = c$.

** Examples

1. Find where the extreme values of $f(x) = x^3 - 12x - 5$ occur.

   \begin{array}{ r l }
   f'(x) & = 3x^2 - 12 \\
   & = 3(x^2 - 4) \\
   & = 3(x + 2)(x - 2) \\
   \end{array}

   $x = \pm 2$

   $f''(x) = 6x$

   $f''(2) = 12$ --- a local maximum occurs at $x = 2$

   $f''(-2) = -12$ --- a local minumum occurs at $x = -2$

** AP Sample Questions

1. Let $g$ be a twice-differentiable function with $g' > 0$ and $g''(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$, such that $g(4) = 12$ and $g(5) = 18$. Which is a possible value of $g(6)$?

   a. 15
   b. 21
   c. 24
   d. 27

   The most likely answer is (D) because $g'$ is positive, and $g''$ is also positive, which means that $g$ must be *exponentially increasing*.

2. The function $f$ has property $f(x), f'(x), f''(x)$ are negative for all real values of $x$. Which of the following could be the graph for $f$?

   [[./ap-question-second-derivative.png]]

Graph (B) is most likely the answer. The range of $f$ is always negative, so it can never be positive at any point. Since $f'$ is negative, $f$ should be decreasing. Since $f''$ is negative, $f'$ should be decreasing, which means $f$ should be exponentially decreasing (i.e. no deceleration).

* Curve Sketching

1. Identify the domain, range, intercepts, asymptotes, and end behavior
2. Find critical points and determine on which intervals the function is inceasing or decreasing
3. Determine points of inflection and the direction of concavity between POIs
4. Plot a few points if necessary to draw the curve about

** Example

Sketch the graph of $f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 4}$

x-intercept: $(0, 0)$

y-intercept: $(0, 0)$

Vertical asymptote: $x = \pm 2$

Horizontal asymptote: $\lim_{x \to \pm \infty} f(x) = 0$

$f(x) = 2x(x^2 - 4)^{-1}$

$f'(x) = \frac{-2x(x^2 + 4)}{(x^2 - 4)^2}$

$f''(x) = \frac{4x(x^2 + 12)}{(x^2 - 4)^3}$

$f'(0) = 0$

$f'(\pm 2) = \textrm{undefined}$

$f''(0) = 0$

$f''(\pm2) = \textrm{undefined}$

   : <-------------------------------------------> f(x)
   :              2         0         2

* Kinematics

\begin{array}{ r l }
    \textrm{Position} & x(t) \\
    \textrm{Velocity} & x'(t) = v(t) \\
    \textrm{Acceleration} & x''(t) = v'(t) = x(t)
\end{array}

** Example

A particle moves along a horizontal axis with velocity given by the function

\[
v(t) = -5 + 2.3e^{\sin(t^2)}
\]

Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at $t = 27$?

\[
v'(t) = 2.3(e^{\sin(t^2)} + -2t\cos(t^2))
\]

\[
a(27) = v'(27) = -120
\]

Because $a(27) < 0$, the particle is decelerating, and which means the particle is slowing down.

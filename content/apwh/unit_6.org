* Changes and Continuities
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: changes-and-continuities
:END:
The period 1750-1900 was indeed revolutionary as political structures
and production changed significantly, while continuities of gender
inequity, racism, and exploitation of lower classes continued. African
kingdoms were subjected to European imperialism, sovereign nations like
China were forced into unequal treaties and mass production pulled all
of the nations of the world together as either providers of resources or
laborers. Gender inequity, racism, and exploitation clearly continued
through the ideology of White Man's Burden, Social Darwinism, and the
civilizing mission. In the name of nationalism, anyone different is
considered "other" and discriminated against across industrializing
nations.

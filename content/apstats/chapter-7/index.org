#+TITLE: Chapter 7 - Combining Distributions

wtf are these notes about

Adding two means of two datasets combines the two means.

Subtracting two means finds the difference between two distirbutions.

Must utilize _variance_

$S_1 + S_2$

Variance of 1 + variance of 2 then square root

$S_1 - S_2$

Variance of 1 - variance of 2 then square root

* Example

| Name    |               |                    |
| Marisol | Average score | Standard deviation |
|         |               |                    |

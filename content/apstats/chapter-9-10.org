* Slightly Curved Data

Some slightly curved data appears to be linear and possesses a high correlation coefficient. However, the curve of the data will reveal itself in the residuals, which would produce a curved pattern.

* Leverage, Influence, and Outliers

Unusual features on a scatterplot exert too much influence on the linear regression. Sometimes these features display a pattern that isn't actually there. Sometimes it brings the regression line towards its location.

If an unusual feature is within the interval of the other datapoints, it is only an outlier and does not exert much influence.

* Re-expression of Data

We can use mathemetical tools such as logarithms, exponentials, and square roots to re-express a curved model as a linear model.

** Goals of Re-expression

- Supply more symmetry
- Adjust scaling to make spreads more similar
- Make the data nearly linear to perform statistical operations
  - Curved data is harder perform statistics on
- Spread out of the clumps of data in a more even way

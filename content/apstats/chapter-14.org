#+TITLE: Chapter 14 - Randomness to Probability

* Vocabulary

- independent event - an event that is not influenced by another event
- disjoint event - mtually exclusive
- law of large numbers - in probability, more trials matches the experimental probability to the theoretical probability
- union - $\cup$ "or"
- intersection - $\cap$ "and"
- complement - $A^c$ "not"
- addition rule - $P(A) + P(B) = P(A \cup B)$ if A and B are mutually exclusive
  - otherwise, $P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = P(A \cup B)$
- multiplication rule - $P(A)P(B) = P(A \cap B)$

* Independent Events

If two events A and B are independent, then

\[
P(A | B) = P(A)
\]

or "probability of A given B is equal to probability of A"

The probability of A should be the same whether or not the event B will occur.

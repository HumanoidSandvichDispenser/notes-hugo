#+TITLE: Subnetting
#+DATE: <2022-10-12 Wed>

Subnetting takes a network and divides it into /subnetworks/.

Example:

~10.0.0.x/24~ splits into ~10.0.0.0~ to ~10.0.0.255~

~10.0.0.x/25~ splits the network into two equal subnets: ~10.0.0.0~ to ~10.0.0.127~ and ~10.0.0.128~ to ~10.0.0.255~

~10.0.0.x/26~ further splits those two parts into four equal subnets.

* Attributes of Subnetting

- Number of IP addresses
  - How many addresses in the network
- CIDR/Subnet
  - The subnet mask that divides a network (and its CIDR notation equivalent)
- Network ID
  - First IP address in each subnet
  - Not allowed to be assigned to a host
- Broadcast ID
  - Last IP address in each subnet
  - Not allowed to be assigned to a host
- First Host IP
  - IP address immediately after the Network ID
  - Assignable to host
- Last Host IP
  - IP address immediately before the Broadcast IP
  - Assignable to host
- Next Network
  - Network ID of the next subnet
  - This will always be the IP address one after the current subnet's broadcast IP

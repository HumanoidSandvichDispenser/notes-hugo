- Go global in minutes
* Technology
*** Well-Architected Infrastructure
- Reliable
  - Fault tolerant
  - High availability
  - Durability
- Secure
- Performant
- Cost-effective
- Operationally excellent
  - Monitored
  - Automated
  - Effective processes
** AWS Global Infrastructure
*** Choosing a region
Things to consider:
- Available services and features
- Cost of services
- Latency and proximity
- Disaster recovery
- Security and compliance laws
*** Availability Zones
- Regions are split in at least two availability zones
- Availability zones have at least one data center
- Spread out and apart
- Connected to each other with a private fiber line
*** Edge Locations
- Important locations for CDN and DNS
- Reside outside AWS region
- Customers do not have access to an edge location itself
** Networking with Amazon VPC
[[./assets/vpc.png]]
*** Amazon VPC
- /Logically/ isolated network
- Created per account per region
- A single VPC spans a single region
- Can all use all AZs in a region
- Can peer with other VPCs
- Uses internet and VPN gateways
*** Three-Tier Architecture
1. Load Balancing tier
2. Application tier
3. Database tier
*** Subnets enable...
- Security via isolation
- High-availability
- Fault tolerance
- Performance
** Routing and Firewalls
*** Routing
- Internet gateways allow networks to communicate with each
- Route tables determines the destination of the traffic
  - Route tables, by themselves, DO NOT allow instances to communicate to the internet; it only routes traffic
- Instances need a *Public IP address to route its traffic to the internet*
*** Network Access Control List
- Acts as a firewall for the subnet
- Allow and denies traffic to the subnets and destination ports
*** Security Groups
- Firewall for the machine
- *Implicitly denies, can only allow*
** DNS, VPN, and Direct Connect
*** Route 53
- Register domains
- Use AWS nameservers
- Public and private DNS zones
- Automated via API
- Health checks
- Different routing methods
  - Latency
  - Geographic
  - Weighted
  - *Failover*
*** Hardware VPN
- Private VPN connection to VPC
- Uses two Amazon Routers
- Good for simple tasks
*** Direct Connect
- Fiber connection to AWS Region
- Through AWS Direct Connect Point of Presence
** Elastic Compute Service (EC2)
- Virtual machines or on bare metal

- Launch one to thousands of instances
- On-demand, reserved, spot billing
- Hourly fee includes OS license
- Normally multi-tenant
- Dedicated hosts
  - Run licensed software
- Dedicated instances
  - Single tenant
*** EC2 Best Practices
- Treat as disposable
- "/Immutable infrastructure/"
- Treat logs as streams (stream to other services)
- Leverage roles
- Automate deployments and enable scaling with auto scaling
- Monitor with CloudWatch
** Lightsail
- Simpler than EC2
- Provides an easier way to host a VPS
- Less configurable overall than EC2
** Elastic Block Store (EBS)
*** Block Storage vs Object Storage
**** Block Storage

- Dynamic port mapping allows instances to receive on different ports
*** Network Load Balancer
- *Layer 4* requests
- /Listens/ to ports
- Uses target groups
- Connections to a static IP address can be spread across instances
- Useful for DNS, firewall rules, and long-running connections
** Simple Storage Service (S3)
- Object storage
- Objects that reside in buckets
- Powered by distributed cluster that spans region
- ~https://bucket.aws-region.com/object~
- *Data at rest is not encrypted by default*
*** Use Cases

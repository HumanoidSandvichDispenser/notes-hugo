* Populations

A population is a *group of individuals* of:
 * the *same species*
 * in the *same area*
 * at the *same time*
 * rely on *same resources*

** Factors that affect population size

 * Abiotic factors
   * Sunlight
   * Precipitation / water
   * Soil / nutrients
 * Biotic factors
   * Prey
   * Competitors
   * Predators, parasites, disease

** Population Dispersion

*** Clumped
 * Most common
*** Random
*** Uniform
 * May result from direct interactions

** Population Density

 * Changes to pop size
   * Adding/removing individuals from a popultaion
     * Birth
     * Death
     * Immigration
     * Emigration
 * /How can we measure population density?/

** Growth Rates

 * Factors affecting growth rate
   * Sex ratio
     * How many females vs males?
   * Generation ratio
     * At what age do females reproduce?
   * Age structure
     * How many females at reproductive age?

** Reproductive Strategies

 * *k-selected*
   * Late reproduction
   * Few offspring
   * Invest a lot in raising offspring
 * *r-selected*
   * Early reproduction
   * Large amounts of offspring
   * Little parental care

** Exponential Growth Rate

 * Characteristic of populations without *limiting factors*
   * Introduced to a new environment or rebounding from a catastrophe

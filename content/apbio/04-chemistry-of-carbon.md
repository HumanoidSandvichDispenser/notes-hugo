# Organic Chemistry

* Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds.
* Carbon atoms are versatile building blocks
  * 4 stable covalent bonds
* All of life is built on carbon
* Cells are made of
  * ~72% H2O
  * ~25% carbon compounds
    * Carbohydrates
    * Lipids
    * Proteins
    * Nucleic Acids
  * ~3% salts

## Organic Chemistry Nomenclature

1 = Meth

2 = Eth

3 = Prop

4 = Bute

5+ = greek prefixes (penta, hexa, etc.)

| Name  | Type of bond | Chemical Formula                |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| N-ane | Single bond  | C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n + 2</sub> |
| N-ene | Double bond  | C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>     |
| N-yne | Triple bond  | C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>n</sub>      |

## Carbon and Multiple Bonding

* It can share four pairs of electrons in four covalent bonds.
* Carbon atoms can also form multiple bonds with other atoms including other
  carbon atoms.

# Most Important Elemetns

* CHONPS
  * Carbon
  * Hydrogen
  * Oxygen
  * Nitrogen
  * Phosphorus
  * Sulfur

# Hydrocarbonds

Hydrocarbonds are combinations of carbons and hydrogens.

* Non-polar
  * Not soluble in water
  * Hydrophobic

# Isomers

* Molecules with same molecular formula but different structures
  * Different chemical properties
  * Different biological functions
* Types of isomers
  * Structural isomers
  * Geometric isomers
    * Different spatial arrangement
* Examples
  * Glucose and galactose

## Stereoisomers or Enantiomers

* Structural differences create important functional differences
  * Amino acid alanine
  * Medicines
    * Thalidomide
      * Prescribed to pregnant women in the 50s and 60s
      * Reduced morning suckness
      * Stereoisomer caused severe birth defects
  * Estrogen and testosterone

Water potential is the measure of the free energy of water. It is the force
responsible for movement of water in a system.

* Has the symbol psi \psi
* Measured in bars or megapascals (MPa)

# Components

* Pressure potential $\psi _s$
    * Results from exertion of pressure
* Solute potential $\psi _p$
    * Determined by solute concentration

# Calculating Water Potential

$$ \psi = \psi _p = \psi _s $$

# Standard for measuring $\psi$

* **Pure water is the standard.**
* Under normal conditions (1 atm), pure water has a water potential of zero.
* $\psi_s$ becomes more negative the more solute it contains
    * The **more solute** it contains, the **more hypertonic** it is.

# Movement

Water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water
potential (higher concentration of solute).

# Calculating Solute Potential

$$ \psi _s = -iCRT $$

where $i = $ number of particles molecule makes in water

where $C = $ molecular concentration

where $R = $ pressure constant

where $T = $ temperature in Kelvin

## Managing water balance

* Cell survival depends on balancing water uptake and loss
* Hypertonic
    * Low concentration of water around cell
        * Animal cells die
* Hypotonic
    * High concentration of water around cell
        * Animal cells burst
        * Plant cells become rigid
* Isotonic
    * No difference in concentration
    * Cells function normally

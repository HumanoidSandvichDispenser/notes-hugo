Cybersecurity does not accept risk at all, but we bring it to an
acceptable level towards upper management. But in order to identify and
mitigate risk, we must follow a set of guidelines to help protect our
systems and networks. Fortunately, NIST has developed the Cybersecurity
Framework which sets a standard and describes the appropriate steps to
developing a well-organized cybersecurity program.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-the-five-functions class=outline-2><h2 id=the-five-functions>The Five Functions</h2><div id=outline-text-the-five-functions class=outline-text-2><p>The five functions consist of identification, protection, detection,
response, and recovery.</p><p>The very first function of the five functions is to <strong>identify</strong> the
assets you are protecting. <em>How are you able to protect something you do
not know exists?</em> In addition to finding what you can protect, you must
also know how the purpose and responsibilities of each asset, how they
work with other assets in the network or system, as well as the
potential risks attributed to that asset. Along with physical objects
such as servers, desktops, and firewalls, assets may also include
digital information such as data on a hard drive. A business should
identify not only their assets, but where they stand on the supply
chain. All this information is essential to develop a risk management
plan.</p><p>In addition, the second function of the five functions is to <strong>protect</strong>
your assets. Your most important responsibility is keeping your systems
safe. One way this can be achieved is through confidentiality,
integrity, and availability. Confidentiality only allows the authorized
parties of the information to view the information. The easiest way to
manage this is with giving read-write-execute permissions. You should
only authorize the intended parties with read and/or write permissions.
Integrity ensures the data is left untampered and unmanipulated by
external factors. Using hash cryptography (by comparing the hashes of
the data) is one way to ensure integrity of the information.
Availability ensures the data is readily accessible and viewable by the
authorized individuals and parties. Data loss and an unmanageable
infrastructure all negatively contribute to the availability of your
data. It is also important that your systems should be easily
maintainable whether you are directly maintaining it or instead from a
remote place. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your
data as well as maintainability and reliable policies and procedures are
important in protecting your assets.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>detect</strong> is the third function of the five functions. Your
organization should be able to detect any events and incidents which may
potentially lead to a severe and destructive impact. Any anomaly and
events must be acknowledged as well as their severity and impact. The
effectiveness of protection should also be evaluated. It is recommended
for organizations to monitor for any of these anomalies and events to
maintain the stability of the infrastructure.</p><p>Furthermore, cybersecurity should be able to <strong>respond</strong> to a cyber event
or incident; they should try to prevent and contain as much damage as
possible. As Mike Tyson said: "Everybody has a plan until they get
punched in the mouth." This also applies to Cybersecurity: you must have
a plan developed before an incident occurs. An incident response plan
describes what has to be done in the event of an incident. The impact of
the incident must also be noted in order to take proper action. In
addition, a business should also respond by effectively communicating
with the stakeholders. As these incidents are detected and responded to,
they should always be learned from by the organization as well as other
organizations and companies to prevent this from occuring in the future.</p><p>After an incident has been detected and responded to, an organization
should figure out how to <strong>recover</strong> from the incident. The infrastructure
should be as resilient as possible to various cybersecurity incidents
brought back up to normal operations as quick as possible. Like having a
response plan ready, it is also optimal to have a recovery plan ready
for a speedy recovery. It is also absolutely crucial for effective
communication within and outside your organization as you are
recovering. From your recovery, your organization can review the risk
management, incident response, and recovery plans, as well as how well
your organization follows the Five Functions of the Cybersecurity
Framework.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-conclusion class=outline-2><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><div id=outline-text-conclusion class=outline-text-2><p>Generally speaking, the Five Functions of NIST's Cybersecurity Framework
are key to maintaining and organizing a cybersecurity program. It
provides the five crucial aspects of cybersecurity and maintaining your
organization. From identifying potential threats to recovering from a
data breach, these guidelines will help assess the security of your
organization. No matter the size, the Cybersecurity Framework will
always fit and better prepare your organization and businesses.</p></div></div><br><div id=nextprev><div></div><div>NEXT: <strong><a class="tag small" href=/cyber/aws-ccp/>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a></strong></div></div></article></content>
